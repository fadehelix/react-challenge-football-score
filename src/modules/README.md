Modules are __complex__ components coupled with specific custom hooks, sub-components, models, etc.
It's inspired by "modules" concept in Angular:

> NgModules are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. They can contain components, service providers, and other code files whose scope is defined by the containing NgModule
